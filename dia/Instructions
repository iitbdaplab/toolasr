# Instructions for running ASR evaluations on TCS data


## 1. First Download 'TCS_recordings' folder from "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11ai2tZ0Jwy_8d_17cjgwSVaxC9QophQt?usp=sharing"

## 2. Extract the downloaded zip file in any directory so that <your dir>/TCS_recordings is the TCS datset location.

## 3. Go the the kaldi directory where the 'decode_eval.sh' script is located.

## 4. If the graph model is not downloaded, you can use a graph created at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oSYHCkm6hz4PZwVvruCS3xgT5fON2gMM?usp=sharing 
     
     OR 
       
##   if you want to build the graph (AM compiled with LM) again Acoustic model is not downloaded, have the Aspire model AM downloaded; Extract the data/local inside 'data' folder in kaldi and exp/chain,exp/nnet3 inside exp; Rename these folders as chain--> chain_cleaned_aspire 
##   and nnet3-->neet3_aspire'. 'build_graph' varaible inside 'decode_eval.sh' is used to build the model when set to 'true'.
##   Detailed Steps:
      1. wget http://kaldi-asr.org/models/1/0001_aspire_chain_model.tar.gz
      2. tar 0001_aspire_chain_model.tar.gz
      4. cp -r exp/{chain,nnet3} <your-kaldi>/egs/toolasr/dia/exp/.
      5. mv exp/chain exp/chain_cleaned_aspire && mv exp/nnet3 exp/nnet3_cleaned

## 5. Set the parameter variables in 'config_eval' file. This configuration file is used by decode.sh script. Set the parameters here properly.

## 6. Run the decode.sh script as ./decode.sh <your dir>/TCS_recordings.





#Rquirements
